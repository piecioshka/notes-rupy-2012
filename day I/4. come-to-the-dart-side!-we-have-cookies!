Come to the Dart side!
We have cookie!
======================

Oh my Dart!

Dart is made for
- "The modern web"
- "Easy of use"
- "Performacne"
- "Tooling"

So dart is a coole langunage - it's rathe boring
Building blocks
Braces & semicolons

Typing - Dynamic
Optional type annotations
> and generics
> for documentation and tooling

"Innocent until proven guilty"

Concurrency
Single-threaded is good
Except when it isn't

No shared memory
Actors > Isolators

Isolated threads

Lightweight isolated thread
Base on names
Only for libraries

Suugar
Only the important right now

Performance
Fast startup
Program elements are declared
Snapshotting
Diet parsing
Compile-time constants
Fast runtime
Beats V8 already (on some benchmarks)
And it just the begginning

Tooling
Dart Editor
Intellij IDEA / WabStorm

So what is it all about?
Structure!
